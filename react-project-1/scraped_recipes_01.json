Tiger nuts are lightly sweet and bold in flavor on their own, which is why I don’t suggest any sweetener in the main recipe. But this milk beverage does take well to flavors. So I've included some of my favorite tigernut milk flavor options. Please note that the Prep time is hands-on time only. Plan ahead so the nuts have time to soak.",

        "notes": "Flavored Mochi: Substitute your desired flavor extract for the vanilla extract, or add a second flavor extract, to taste. This is a great way to get creative with the flavor and to add more intensity. Another option is to use fruit juice in place of the water. Popular options are guava, yuzu, lilikoi / passion fruit, or mango juice (not puree). A third option is to use a powder, like matcha powder or freeze-dried fruit powder. With matcha, add about 1 tablespoon of powder with the flour. Freeze-dried fruit powder isn't as strong, so you will want to use 2 to 4 tablespoons of the powder. Layered Mochi: For two layer mochi, divide the mochi batter in half and color and/or flavor each half. Pour one half into your prepared pan, cover, and bake it for 15 minutes. Carefully remove the tinfoil using tongs (to avoid the steam), and pour on the second half of the batter. Cover it again, and finish baking for the remaining 45 minutes. For three-layer mochi, the process is the same, but you'll divide the batter in thirds, adding the second layer after 15 minutes of baking, and the third layer after 30 minutes of baking.",

        "description": "Hawaiians love adding dairy to mochi, but this variation is naturally dairy-free and made with coconut milk. I've adapted it slightly from my friend Sharleen's recipe, and she adapted it from Hawai'i's Best Mochi Recipes cookbook.",

        "ingredients": [
            "1 pound mochiko (sweet rice flour)",
            "2¼ cups sugar",
            "1½ teaspoons baking powder",
            "1 (13.5-ounce) can coconut milk",
            "1½ cups water",
            "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
            "Few drops natural food color (optional)",
            "Potato starch or cornstarch, for rolling."
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat your oven to 350°F, and grease or line a 9x13-inch baking dish with parchment paper.",
            "In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the mochiko, sugar, and baking powder.",
            "Add the coconut milk, water, and vanilla and whisk well until combined.",
            "Whisk in food coloring, if desired.",
            "Pour the mixture into your prepared pan and cover it tightly with tinfoil.",
            "Bake the mochi for 1 hour.",
            "Lift the foil off using tongs from a corner so the steam doesn't vent on you.",
            "Let the mochi cool completely, which can take a few hours.",
            "Loosen the edges of the mochi and lift it out of the pan onto a cutting boar. Cut the mochi into squares or small rectangles with a plastic knife, separating it as you cut to avoid re-sticking. Roll each piece in starch.",
            "Serve the same day. Individually wrap and freeze any leftover mochi."
        ],
        "notes": "Flavored Mochi: Substitute your desired flavor extract for the vanilla extract, or add a second flavor extract, to taste. This is a great way to get creative with the flavor and to add more intensity. Another option is to use fruit juice in place of the water. Popular options are guava, yuzu, lilikoi / passion fruit, or mango juice (not puree). A third option is to use a powder, like matcha powder or freeze-dried fruit powder. With matcha, add about 1 tablespoon of powder with the flour. Freeze-dried fruit powder isn't as strong, so you will want to use 2 to 4 tablespoons of the powder. Layered Mochi: For two layer mochi, divide the mochi batter in half and color and/or flavor each half. Pour one half into your prepared pan, cover, and bake it for 15 minutes. Carefully remove the tinfoil using tongs (to avoid the steam), and pour on the second half of the batter. Cover it again, and finish baking for the remaining 45 minutes. For three-layer mochi, the process is the same, but you'll divide the batter in thirds, adding the second layer after 15 minutes of baking, and the third layer after 30 minutes of baking.",
